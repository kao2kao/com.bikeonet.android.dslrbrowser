## Features

With DSLR Browser you can connect through Wi-Fi to a Canon digital SLR camera equipped with a wireless transmitter like the WFT-E5 and WFT-E7 (Ver.2).

Currently tested with a few Canon EOS cameras and optional/built-in WFT transmitters - but should work with any Canon DSLR and transmitter capable of UPNP MediaServ mode.

With DSLR Browser you can connect through Wi-Fi to a Canon digital SLR camera equipped with a wireless transmitter like the WFT-E5 or the WFT-E7 (Ver.2). Switch the transmitter to MediaServ mode then connect with your Android or iOS device (phone or tablet) to the same Wi-Fi network the camera is connected to (or use the phone's tethered wifi connection) and watch the app automatically discover your camera. Change to the Photos tab and start browsing, downloading or sharing pictures right off your dslr!
